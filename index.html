    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <br>
        <p>My name is Kitrick Bell born in one of the biggest cities in the world, Houston, Texas. Being in a city so big, surrounded by diversity, inspired me to learn about different cultures
            try new food, travel overseas and even learn new languages. I am inspired to learn about the world around it and everything it had to offer no matter how strange or difficult the task may be.</p> 
          
          <p> I started off at an early age falling in love with the game of basketball. Everyday I would look forward to playing the game in the neighborhood against people of all types. Some 
              were much bigger,older had and much more experience than I did. But I still wanted to go out there and bring what I had to offer to the court. I learned by watching how the game was played but I developed skills with hands on experiece.
                I continued to work on my game by practicing everyday on things that needed improvement. Working on things I personally wanted to strenghen and building on things that I have mastered and applying it in real game situations.
                Doing that made me a more well rounded player because I was able to be more versaltile in my position. Basketball taught me how to work with a team, and how to understand the value in what is that I have to offer. </p> 
               
               <p> Basketball has taught me how to manage my time when it comes to handling a full schedule, and how to work extremely well under pressure. In my junior year in college My team and I made history by becoming the first team in school history to make it to the
                NCAA national championship and I earned honors as an All American recognized across the nation.

                I believe my team and I were able to accomplish this because we had a good umderstanding of the value we brougt as an indiviual. We understood what our indiviual talents were and use that to help push the team as a whole.
                    With everything that playing ball has taught me I see the importance of hard work, and the
